# ðŸŽµ SATB Chorale Generator with LSTM

This project generates Bach-style SATB (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) chorales using a **deep learning LSTM model** trained on the **JSB Chorales dataset**. The generated chorales are saved as MIDI files and can be played or converted to WAV for audio playback.  

---

## Features

- Train an LSTM model on real Bach chorales.  
- Generates **SATB chorales** with separate S-A-T-B voices.  
- Converts MIDI to WAV for direct playback in Colab or locally.  
- Colab-friendly with fast audio rendering using **Timidity**.  
- Handles rests and ensures MIDI notes are within valid pitch ranges.  

---

## Dataset

- [JSB Chorales dataset](https://github.com/czhuang/JSB-Chorales-dataset)  
- Contains four-part chorales encoded as 16th-note sequences.  
- Preprocessed into training sequences for LSTM input.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/satb-chorale-generator.git
cd satb-chorale-generator
pip install numpy tensorflow pretty_midi midi2audio
# For Colab playback
apt-get install -y timidity
# Load dataset
import numpy as np
data = np.load("chorales/JSB-Chorales-dataset-master/Jsb16thSeparated.npz", allow_pickle=True)
sequences = data["train"]

# Flatten sequences, encode notes, and prepare training sequences
# ... (see training code)
